# Lua-Research
This is where I post different Lua snippets that I've worked on. The majority of these snippets can be implemented into modules to facilitate with problems or to create a framwork.

I have given examples from using Object Oriented Programming to using Functional Programming in a procedural language!
This showcases many unique take ons on performing different tasks in Lua
